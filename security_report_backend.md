## Introduction
This report provides a detailed security analysis of the provided source code. Each code file will be analyzed to identify potential vulnerabilities and best practices will be recommended to improve the overall security of the project.

## Executive Summary
This analysis focuses on the `AuthController.ts`, `UserController.ts`, and `User.ts` files that handle authentication and user management in an Express.js application. Several points of vulnerability were identified and recommendations were proposed to strengthen code security.

## Code Analysis

### File 1: AuthController.ts

#### 1. File Description
The `AuthController.ts` file contains the control logic for user authentication in an Express.js application. It manages the following functionalities:
- User registration (`register`)
- User login (`login`)
- Retrieving information from the logged-in user (`getMe`)
- Changing password (`changePassword`)

#### 2. Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Validation of Entries**
   - **Registration**: Validation of user fields is performed, but no protection measures against injection attacks are mentioned.
   - **Login**: No in-depth verification of inputs is performed before using them in queries.
   - **Password Change**: Validation of the `oldPassword` and `newPassword` fields is minimal.

2. **Password Management**
   - Passwords are hashed, but the type of hash used is not specified. Poor implementation can leave passwords vulnerable.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Returned error messages may disclose sensitive information (e.g., distinguishing between incorrect username and incorrect password).
   - The API returns generic HTTP statuses which do not give sufficient information on the nature of the errors.

4. **JWT Token Management**
   - JWT tokens are signed, but the security of the secret key (`config.jwtSecret`) is not guaranteed.
   - Token lifetime is set to one hour, which can be short or long depending on context, with no refresh mechanism mentioned.

#### 3. Recommendations

1. **Validation of Entries**
   - Use robust validation libraries to validate all user input and protect against SQL injections and other types of injection attacks.
   - Implement checks for length, format, and other constraints on input fields.

2. **Password Management**
   - Use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt with a sufficient number of rounds to strengthen password security.
   - Add measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as rate limiting.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Avoid disclosing specific information about errors in HTTP responses. Use generic error messages and log server-side error details.
   - Use appropriate and detailed HTTP statuses to indicate different errors.

4. **JWT Token Management**
   - Ensure that the JWT secret key is stored securely and is not exposed in the source code.
   - Implement a mechanism for refreshing JWT tokens to extend the user session in a secure manner.

### File 2: UserController.ts

#### 1. File Description
The `UserController.ts` file contains the control logic for managing users in an Express.js application. It manages the following functionalities:
- List of all users (`listAll`)
- Retrieving user information by ID (`getOneById`)
- Creation of a new user (`newUser`)
- Editing an existing user (`editUser`)
- Deleting a user (`deleteUser`)

#### 2. Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Validation of Entries**
   - **User Creation**: Validation of user fields is performed, but no protection measures against injection attacks are mentioned.
   - **User Modification**: Validation of the `username` and `role` fields is minimal.
   - **User Deletion**: No in-depth verification of entries is performed before their use in queries.

2. **Password Management**
   - Passwords are hashed when a user is created, but the type of hash used is not specified.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Returned error messages may disclose sensitive information (e.g., distinguishing between user not found and other error).
   - The API returns generic HTTP statuses which do not give sufficient information on the nature of the errors.

4. **Permissions Management**
   - No verification of user permissions or roles is mentioned for sensitive operations (creation, modification, deletion).

#### 3. Recommendations

1. **Validation of Entries**
   - Use robust validation libraries to validate all user input and protect against SQL injections and other types of injection attacks.
   - Implement checks for length, format, and other constraints on input fields.

2. **Password Management**
   - Use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt with a sufficient number of rounds to strengthen password security.
   - Add measures to prevent brute force attacks, such as rate limiting.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Avoid disclosing specific information about errors in HTTP responses. Use generic error messages and log server-side error details.
   - Use appropriate and detailed HTTP statuses to indicate different errors.

4. **Permissions Management**
   - Implement checking of user permissions and roles for sensitive operations to ensure that only authorized users can perform these actions.

### File 3: User.ts

#### 1. File Description
The `User.ts` file defines the `User` entity used in the database. This entity contains the following information:
- User ID (`id`)
- Username (`username`)
- Password (`password`)
- User role (`role`)
- Creation date (`createdAt`)
- Updated date (`updatedAt`)

#### 2. Identified Vulnerabilities

1. **Field Validation**
   - Validation constraints are defined, but additional controls may be necessary to ensure data security.

2. **Password Management**
   - The password is hashed using `bcryptjs` with a salt of 8 rounds. Although this is common practice, it is recommended to use a higher number of rounds to improve safety.

3. **Password Exclusion**
   - The `@Exclude` decorator of `class-transformer` is used to exclude the password when transforming the user object. However, it is important to verify that this is correctly applied in all transformations.

4. **Date Management**
   - Creation and update dates are managed automatically by `typeorm`. It is important to ensure that these dates are correctly updated and used securely.

#### 3. Recommendations

1. **Field Validation**
   - Add additional controls for user fields, such as regex for formatting usernames and passwords, and stricter length controls.

2. **Password Management**
   - Increase the number of hashing rounds for `bcryptjs` to at least 12 to improve the security of stored passwords.
   - Ensure that the hashing process is performed asynchronously to avoid thread locks.

3. **Password Exclusion**
   - Check that the `@Exclude` decorator is applied correctly in all transformations of the user object to avoid leaking passwords in API responses.

4. **Date Management**
   - Check that creation and update dates are correctly managed and that update operations are secure to avoid malicious manipulation.

## General Advice
- **Secure Configurations**: Ensure that all sensitive configurations (like secret keys) are stored securely, for example by using environment variables.
- **Update and Audit**: Keep all dependencies up to date and perform regular code audits to identify and fix new vulnerabilities.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to quickly detect and respond to suspicious activities.

## Conclusion
The `AuthController.ts`, `UserController.ts` and `User.ts` files contain several basic best practices for user management and security. However, improvements can be made to strengthen the overall security of the application. The recommendations provided in this report should be implemented to mitigate identified vulnerabilities and enhance the security posture of the project.
